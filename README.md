TOP's Project: Landing Page

Self-reflection of step-by-step:
- create GitHub repository and clone to local machine
- add files and directories using 'touch', 'mkdir', and 'cp'

- build basic structure of HTML
- focus on the header section structure and add basic CSS first
- move down layer by layer, adding additional <div> containers as needed

- indicate the flexboxes, image placements, and other relevant CSS details
- improve margin, padding, and gaps


Hindsights:
- Windows 11's recommended (maybe even default?) display scaling is 125%, which zooms browser pages by about 25%, which in turn, squished most of the website's content. This was not an issue to VM/Linux's 100% display scaling.
- Added wrapping on images when browser shrinks.
- Enhanced gap, padding and margin usage to maintain cohesiveness.
- Identify difference between usage of 'align-self: flex-end' vs. 'text-align: right'.
- Identify difference between usage of 'flex-wrap: nowrap' vs. 'white-space: nowrap'.
